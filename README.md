### Extended Kalman filter for Premier League football

Based on the code from the [posteriors](https://normal-computing.github.io/posteriors/tutorials/ekf_premier_league/) tutorial and the paper [A State-Space Perspective on Modelling and Inference for Online Skill Rating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02414). I've used Polars instead of Pandas and extended the range of dates to include the 2023/2024 season.
